          What if you could play a game online with a friend, peer-to-peer,
          without needing a backend server? Just two players connected directly
          through the magic of <strong>WebRTC</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>PeerJS</strong>. We are going to explore how this was
          accomplished in <a href="/tic-tac-toe">Tic-Tac-Toe</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Peer-to-Peer: No Servers, No Problem</h2>
        <p>
          WebRTC is used to establish a direct connection between two players
          (the host and the guest). Here’s how it plays a crucial role:
          Peer-to-peer connection: Instead of sending requests to a server to
          fetch or update the game state, WebRTC establishes a direct connection
          between two browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          This enables low-latency communication, which is ideal for real-time
          applications like games. WebRTC's data channel is key here. It’s a
          bi-directional communication channel between two peers, allowing them
          to send messages, like game moves, back and forth instantly. For
          example, when a player makes a move on their board, that move is
          transmitted via the data channel to the opponent, who updates their
          board state in real-time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most multiplayer games rely on a server to shuttle messages back and
          forth. WebRTC skips all that. It lets two players
          <strong>connect directly</strong> and
          <strong>exchange data instantly</strong>. That means no need for an
          expensive backend.
        </p>

        <h2>PeerJS: Making WebRTC Easy</h2>
        <p>
          WebRTC is great, but setting it up can be a headache. Enter{" "}
          <strong>PeerJS</strong>, which simplifies everything. Instead of
          dealing with connection details, PeerJS assigns each player a{" "}
          <strong>unique ID</strong>. One player shares their ID, the other
          connects, and boom—game on.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 1: new Peer</h3>
        <p>
          Each player needs to have an instance of <code>new Peer()</code> to
          participate in PeerJs backed WebRTC. The peer object takes some time
          to be set up. So once a new Peer() is created, we must wait for the{" "}
          <code>peer.on('open', ...</code>) event handler to be triggered in
          order to guarantee the Peer object has been competely set up.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2: Hosting</h3>
        <p>
          One player's <code>Peer</code> object will act as a host. After the
          open Event Handler is triggered on the host peer, its code can be
          shared to a client to create a data channel. Once that data channel is
          created, the host peer's <code>peer.on('connection', ...)</code> event
          handler is triggered. The event handler will pass a ready peer js{" "}
          <code>DataConnection</code> object to the callback triggered. This
          DataConnection is a data channel to send and recieve messages to the
          connected client.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3: Joining</h3>
        <p>
          The other player's <code>Peer</code> object will connect to a host
          using the host's peer ID. This will be done via{" "}
          <code> const conn = peer.connect(hostPeerId)</code>
          conn in this code snippet is of type <code>DataConnection</code>. The{" "}
          <code>DataConnection</code> takes some time to set up once
          <code>connect</code> is called. We will listen to the{" "}
          <code>DataConnection</code>'s <code>conn.on("open", ...)</code> event
          handler to be triggered to ensure the DataConnection is done being set
          up.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 4: Sending and Recieving data</h3>
        <p>
          Both the host and the client should subscribe to the{" "}
          <code>conn.on("data", ...)</code> event handler. This event handler
          will trigger a callback and pass data recieved via the{" "}
          <code>DataConnection</code>. Both the host and the client can send
          data via <code>conn.send</code>
